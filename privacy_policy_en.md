# Privacy Policy for Username Password Generator

Last updated: 2025-09-10

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Username Password Generator ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Chrome browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.

## Information Collection

The Extension does not collect, track, or store any personally identifiable information about you. It does not monitor your browsing activity, collect your website usage data, or gather any information about the websites you visit.

## How Information is Stored

Any password generation rules you configure within the Extension are securely stored on your local device using the Chrome Storage API. This data remains entirely on your device and is not accessible by any external parties.

## Information Transmission

The Extension does not send, transmit, or store any of your configured rules or generated passwords to any external servers. All password generation and rule processing occurs locally on your device.

## Permission Usage

The Extension requires the following permissions to function properly:

- **activeTab**: This permission allows the Extension to access the current tab's URL to suggest appropriate usernames and passwords based on the website you're visiting.
- **clipboardWrite**: This permission enables the Extension to copy generated usernames and passwords to your clipboard for convenient use.
- **storage**: This permission is used to store your password generation preferences and rules locally on your device.

These permissions are strictly limited to the core functionality of the Extension and are never used for any other purpose.

## Data Security

We take data security seriously. All information stored by the Extension is protected by Chrome's built-in security mechanisms. Since all data remains on your local device, you have complete control over your information.

## User Control

You have full control over the information stored by the Extension. You can view, modify, or delete your password generation rules at any time through the Extension's settings page. Additionally, you can uninstall the Extension at any time, which will remove all associated data from your device.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
